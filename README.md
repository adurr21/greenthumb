Green Thumb

Over and Under watering are one of the biggest contributers to plant death. Green Thumb helps gardeners keep track of a watering schedule to ensure their plants are getting sufficient ammount of water. Users will add their plants to 'My Plants' wich will automatically add their plants watering cycle to a calender. They will be notified by text or email when it is time to water their plants. Users can learn more about a specific plant by selecting them under the 'My Plant' page.
