                <p class="align-center">Lettuce is one of the most common vegetables. It is very easy to grow, and does not require lots of maintenance.</p>
                <p class="align-center">The plant thrives in temperatures between 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit.
                Temperatures must remain above freezing at all times in order for the plant to stay alive.
                </p>
                <p class="align-center">Lettuce needs to be watered when the soil is dry. Once or twice a week is sufficient in watering.
                    The plant grows best in cooler climates, but can also grow very well in warmer climates as long as shade is present.
