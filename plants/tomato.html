                <p class="align-center">The tomato plant is cultivated in tropical and temperate climates.</p>
                <p class="align-center">The plant thrives in temperatures between 55 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
                Temperatures must remain above freezing at all times in order for the plant to stay alive.

                <p class="align-center">When tomatoes first start growing, they need to be watered daily.
                As the plant grows, the amount of water needed decreases. When fully grown, the plant only needs to be watered every 2-3 days.
